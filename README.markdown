# Unitard. Skintight!

You know, this tiny... - skintight project was made for two reasons:

    1. Provide possibility to limit bandwidth of any  internet adapter to consume lesser Internet. I know, i know… Nowadays it is - absurd. But…
    
    2. Allow to simulate very slow and unreliable connections for testing web-app behaviour.

### OS supported:
- MacOS 10.8.x, but i beleive that version does not matter

TODO:

[x] Basic Implementation. Set bandwidth. Revert changes. Show status. 

[..] Add linux wondershaper support

[..] Add linux tc support

[..] Cover with tests

[..] Add option to zip command to add 


You are more than welcome to take this unitard and do whathever … stahp! stahp! Not this, oh mercy…


p.s. the name of the gem is so cool, so, obviously i will reuse it later for something else :)

Bravest Warriors - Dan Before Time. My favourite one.
